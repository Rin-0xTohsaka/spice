How to add to the code:

This script is responsible for running the Flask application. 
It's already quite simple and focused, so there isn't much to add. However, here are a few ideas for potential improvements:

Configurable port: The port number is currently hardcoded. 
You could make it configurable, either by reading an environment variable or by accepting a command line argument.

Production mode: Right now, the application always runs in debug mode, which isn't suitable for a production environment. 
You could add a way to toggle debug mode off when deploying the application.

Host configuration: Flask's development server will only be accessible from the same machine by default. 
You might want to add a host configuration option (like '0.0.0.0') to make the server externally visible if it's safe and required.

Remember that Flask's built-in server is not designed to be particularly efficient, stable, or secure, so you should not use it to run a production web application. 
Instead, consider using a production WSGI server such as Gunicorn or uWSGI.
